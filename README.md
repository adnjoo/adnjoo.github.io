# JAMstack blog

> the blog is available [here](https://adnjoo.github.io/)

## How do I run the site?
```
npm install
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```
The above command will build into folder \_site. 
We then push this repo separately into the gh-pages branch where we tell GH to build our webpage from.

* main branch - JAMSTACK template generator 

* gh-pages branch - github deploys from here
