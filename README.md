# JAMstack blog

> the blog is available [here](https://adnjoo.github.io/)

## How do I run the site?
```
npm install
npm i moment
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```
The above command will build into the '_site' folder.

We then push this repo into the gh-pages branch where GH builds the webpage from.

* main branch - JAMSTACK template generator

* gh-pages branch - github deploys from here
