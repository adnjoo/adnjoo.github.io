thoughts about the Gu.

<!-- Excerpt End -->

Canggu is an area in Center-West Bali. It is just above Seminyak (the hip trendy area), and just below the famous Tanah Lot temple.

There are many stylish things to see and do in the Gu including: checking out cafe racers on the streets, drinking some freshly brewed Americanos, riding long long waves on Batu Bolong beach, and just chilling out.

Some of my favorite joints in the area are Machinery Cafe Bali (MCB) and the Deus Ex Machina cafe. You can find fast internet there!
