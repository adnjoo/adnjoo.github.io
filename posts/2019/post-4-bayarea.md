Great Blue Herons hanging out in Don Edwards wildlife refuge

Saw a pretty cool startup the other day called Firefly. They put digital advertising on full-time rideshare vehicles (Uber & Lyft). I guess the rideshare industry has come full circle..

Also ate some of these yummy burgers @ In n Out, as well as lots of coffee at Blue Bottle & Coffee Bar.
